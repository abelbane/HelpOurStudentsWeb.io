              Effective September 1, 2022, each recipient receives $150 each month,
          from September through June, for a total of $1,500.
          The Help Our Students Program is a not-for-profit organization,
          registered as a charity under the Income Tax Act (Canada).
          100% of all donations are distributed to students who are selected by
          their school. Your donations are never used to pay administrative
          costs which are paid by the volunteer Board of Directors.
          Donors receive an annual President’s Report. Each President’s Report
          contains a financial statement and a link to the recipients’ letters
          describing how the Help Our Students Program has impacted their
          lives.<br><br>
              There are many ways to donate to the Help Our Students Program:
              <br> Directly by cheque or etransfer   
              <br>Online by credit card, debit card or PayPal       
              <br>By donating shares.  
              <br>You can specify which school you wish to support or let us use your donation where it’s most needed.
              <br>You can make a donation in honour of someone (e.g. your child’s teacher) or in memory of a loved one.  When you choose to make a dedicated donation, we will send a donation card to you or to the address you specify.

You will be transferred to the CanadaHelps website, a Canadian registered charity that processes online donations for Canadian charities.  Once you donate, you will receive your receipt for income tax purposes directly from CanadaHelps.
              You may make a one-time donation or a monthly, recurring donation that you may stop at any time.
              Please note that CanadaHelps deducts 4.0% of each donation (3.5% for monthly donations) to cover their processing and administrative costs.  Once we receive the remaining amount, all of it is distributed to students.

            <p>
              You can donate shares in Canadian equities.  When you donate shares to a charitable organization, you receive an official receipt for tax purposes for the amount of the sale of the shares and you are exempt from paying tax on any capital gains incurred as a result of the sale. The CanadaHelps fee for processing securities varies between 2% - 3%, depending on the value of the securities.
              For more information on donating securities, click here to visit the Canada Revenue Agency.
